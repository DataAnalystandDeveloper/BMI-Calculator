This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python. The program takes the user's weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) as input and calculates their BMI. It then categorizes the BMI based on standard weight classifications.
## How It Works
The program calculates BMI using the formula:

\[
BMI = \frac{{weight \times 703}}{{height^2}}
\]

Based on the calculated BMI, it provides feedback on the user's weight category, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
